Project title:
Algorithmic Regression Model Performance During Global Crisis Periods

Description:
This project analyzes the predictive performance of linear and logistic regression models in forecasting market movements during major global financial crises (2008 Global Financial Crisis and 2020 COVID-19 crash).

Using financial data from global stock indices across developed and developing markets, regression models were implemented in Python to evaluate prediction accuracy under high-volatility conditions. The analysis compares model performance across crisis and non-crisis periods to assess whether simple algorithmic models remain effective during market turbulence.

Key tasks:

Cleaned and structured multi-country financial market datasets

Implemented linear and logistic regression models using Python

Evaluated model accuracy across different crisis periods

Visualized performance trends and compared model effectiveness

Interpreted findings for financial risk and market prediction insights

Tools: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, data visualization
